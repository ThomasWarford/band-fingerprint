# Electronic Band Fingerprinting
## Rules
- Each fingerprint has a corresponding dataframe.
- Fingerprint creation & clustering is performed in `fingerprint_creation`.
- Fingerprints are saved to `fingerprints`, with descriptive names.
- The last part of the fingerprint csv name is the fingerprint length.
- Analysis/plotting of fingerprints happens in `analyis`.
- .py files containing functions, ect go in `src`.
- Miscellaneous/messy files go in `misc`
